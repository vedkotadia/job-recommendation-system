Censeo Consulting Group is a top Washington D.C. based management consulting firm dedicated to helping public sector and non-profit clients build operational excellence, deliver better outcomes, and lower cost. We take a personalized approach to strategic consulting to solve our clients’ most complex problems and build operational excellence that transforms their organizations, allowing them to better deliver on their public and social missions.

At Censeo, our award-winning culture means you’ll join a tight-knit community of 75 brilliant and passionate colleagues. We are advocates for a better functioning public sector, and we’re also good friends who know the names of each other’s dogs. Our philosophy is horizontal, not hierarchical, and our open-door policy encourages a culture of entrepreneurship at all levels. We share successes, make decisions together, and foster an environment for those with passion and initiative (Business Analysts especially!) to lead. Our colleagues bring their own unique personalities to work every day and use them to help shape our growing firm in ways that reach far beyond client projects.

The Position:

We are looking for passionate, driven candidates to help solve our client’s complex problems and guide them towards operational success. As a Business Analyst with Censeo, you won’t spend your first few years doing tedious project work. Instead, you will jump right into the heart of consulting and play an important role on your teams from day one, owning your own section of work and even driving projects forward based on the initiative and enthusiasm that you bring. A typical day in the life of a Business Analyst is never quite the same, but it is always equally exciting and challenging. On any given day, you could be performing critical analyses, helping shape final recommendations for clients, creating deliverables, or presenting your work to Censeo leadership and senior clients. Some of your key responsibilities as a Business Analyst will include:


 * Supporting all aspects of client engagements from defining the strategy of a project to preparing final deliverables
 * Conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis of data to identify trends, find opportunities areas, and develop meaningful insights
 * Developing in-depth knowledge of client issues, needs, and contexts
 * Collaborating with teams (typically 3-7 team members per project) to recommend realistic solutions to their problems and encourage innovative, bold thinking
 * Sharing insights, results, and recommendations in a comprehensible manner through both written presentations/reports and interactions with teams/clients
   
   
   

The Ideal Candidate:

At Censeo, we are looking for unique candidates whose passion and enthusiasm will help shape Censeo’s client insights and workplace culture. Our staff have a wide range of backgrounds, areas of expertise, personality types, and favorite breakfast foods. Our client and cultural successes are rooted in our team’s innovation, creative problem solving, and collaboration. The unique perspective that you bring and the way you tackle problems are much more important to us than what’s printed on your diploma. We believe a successful Business Analyst will have:


 * BA/BS required with a strong academic background
 * Superior creative problem-solving, analytical, and quantitative skills
 * Ability to work effectively on projects with demanding deadlines in a team environment
 * Effective written and verbal communication skills with an ability to share and synthesize knowledge
 * Ability and desire to take initiative and ownership over project work and professional development and growth

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

About RoomOne Solutions

Ever heard of a PTAC?

No?

You actually see them all the time.

But don’t worry, you’re not alone.

A “PTAC,” or Packaged Terminal Air Conditioner, is the in-wall AC unit you most commonly see below the window in your hotel room. At RoomOne Solutions, we sell new and refurbished PTACs; manage the removal and installation of PTACs in the field; and refurbish used PTAC units to extend their useful life.

Our core customer market is hoteliers – ranging from the world’s largest brands to independent “mom and pop” small-business owners. Additionally, we also support residential homeowners, as well as customers in managed care, multi-family housing, and dormitories.

The thing that makes us a little different is that we spend a lot of our time focused on refurbished PTACs. We obtain used PTACs from the field, refurbish them using Lean Manufacturing techniques and processes, and then sell them via online, call center, and enterprise channels. We do this at scale, with the mission of providing the lowest cost of conditioned air to the PTAC market.

 * Demand Creation & Capture:
    * Develop and execute strategies to create demand and capture market interest through various marketing channels
    * Optimize customer conversion paths through experimentation and data driven UI/UX performance
      

About You

In order to execute these objectives, you will need to embody the following behaviors:


 * Customer Centricity: develop an expert understanding of our customers, empathize with their hopes and fears, and relentlessly solve their problems before they know they have them
 * Bias To Action: roll up your sleeves, get in the weeds, move fast, drive action, and Get. Stuff. Done
 * Iterative Problem-Solving: embody open-mindedness and curiosity when confronting problems, collaborate and experiment with the team, and “ship-iterate-monitor.”

Description:

Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is a critical component of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies. Its main purpose is to comply with regulations by identifying and verifying the identity of customers, thereby reducing the risk of money laundering and ensuring transparent and honest business relationships with all potential customers. CDD acts as a powerful defense mechanism to protect an institution’s reputation from those who might attempt to compromise its integrity.

This role will support the Cornerstone Customer Due Diligence Application and will be responsible for the following.

Responsibilities:


 * Customer identification: Confirm the customer’s identity correctly using reliable, independent source documents, data, or information.
 * Customer verification: Review pertinent identification documents such as passports, licenses, or government-issued identification cards. In companies, you may need to verify articles of incorporation, business licenses, and other associated documents.
 * Know Your Customer (KYC): Understand the nature and purpose of the customer relationship. Gather information about the customer’s business or occupation to understand their intended transactions or activities.
 * Risk assessment: Conduct a thorough risk assessment based on customer information, the products/services they require, and their geographic location. This risk profile will help determine what level of due diligence is required—simplified, basic, or enhanced.
 * Enhanced due diligence: For customers assessed as high risk, conduct enhanced due diligence (EDD). This could involve deeper investigation into business operations, sources of wealth and funds, scrutinizing past transactions, checking against sanctions lists, or the background of the beneficial owners.
 * Ongoing monitoring: Regularly review and update customer information. Track customer transactions, particularly those that deviate from normal activities. This step is crucial to identify any changes in risk level.
 * Record keeping: Keep clear records of all customer interactions, documents, identification checks, and risk assessments.
 * Reporting: If there are suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing, report them to the relevant authorities. Maintain a strict internal reporting procedure.
   
   

Required Qualifications:


 * 5+ years of Information Technology and Business Analysis in support of Business Services experience
 * Experience with AML, KYC, and financial crimes is a plus.

Role

You will drive the ingestion and integration of core data domains to be leveraged by Business Intelligence / Advanced Analytics teams to gain insights on our client's successes and opportunities. You will propel analytics through robust data comprehension, requirement mapping, data modeling, and cross-functional partnership for solution delivery. With this diverse role, areas of potential focus range from:


 * data architecture design to direct business process evolution,
 * backlog prioritization and management,
 * reverse engineering to understand and evolve an existing solution,
 * researching a critical source system/service to automate ingestion,
 * educating teammates on your robust knowledge of business data requirements and business process, and
 * requirement documentation for engineering development. This role will be vital in shaping the landscape by which analytics teams interact with and leverage data, as each release broadens available data sets and expands analytics self-serve capabilities.
   
   

If you’re right for this role, you’re a data evangelist with hands-on SQL and/or Snowflake experience, agile product experience, strong communication skills and attention to detail, and a thorough understanding of data products and architecture.

In your daily work, you actively seek the most effective path forward and are insistent on progress. You are equally comfortable working in a relational data store and a Lakehouse eco-system. To you, the importance of value-based solutions, incremental progress, and failing fast is clear, and you can demonstrate how each of these helps to drive business results. You enjoy finding relationships between disparate data sets and clarity in a muddied data environment. When it is time to simplify a complex technical idea onto a whiteboard for a non-technical audience, you want the pen in your hand.

 * Minimum 8 years of related professional experience ideal
 * Proven ability to sift through requirements, identify critical information, analyze, document and work with an engineering team on solution options

"Business Analyst - Spring 2024","Washington, DC","2024-03-01","Censeo Consulting Group","Business Analyst

Target Start Date: Spring 2024

The Company:

Censeo Consulting Group is a top Washington D.C. based management consulting firm dedicated to helping public sector and non-profit clients build operational excellence, deliver better outcomes, and lower cost. We take a personalized approach to strategic consulting to solve our clients’ most complex problems and build operational excellence that transforms their organizations, allowing them to better deliver on their public and social missions.

At Censeo, our award-winning culture means you’ll join a tight-knit community of 75 brilliant and passionate colleagues. We are advocates for a better functioning public sector, and we’re also good friends who know the names of each other’s dogs. Our philosophy is horizontal, not hierarchical, and our open-door policy encourages a culture of entrepreneurship at all levels. We share successes, make decisions together, and foster an environment for those with passion and initiative (Business Analysts especially!) to lead. Our colleagues bring their own unique personalities to work every day and use them to help shape our growing firm in ways that reach far beyond client projects.

The Position:

We are looking for passionate, driven candidates to help solve our client’s complex problems and guide them towards operational success. As a Business Analyst with Censeo, you won’t spend your first few years doing tedious project work. Instead, you will jump right into the heart of consulting and play an important role on your teams from day one, owning your own section of work and even driving projects forward based on the initiative and enthusiasm that you bring. A typical day in the life of a Business Analyst is never quite the same, but it is always equally exciting and challenging. On any given day, you could be performing critical analyses, helping shape final recommendations for clients, creating deliverables, or presenting your work to Censeo leadership and senior clients. Some of your key responsibilities as a Business Analyst will include:


 * Supporting all aspects of client engagements from defining the strategy of a project to preparing final deliverables
 * Conducting quantitative and qualitative analysis of data to identify trends, find opportunities areas, and develop meaningful insights
 * Developing in-depth knowledge of client issues, needs, and contexts
 * Collaborating with teams (typically 3-7 team members per project) to recommend realistic solutions to their problems and encourage innovative, bold thinking
 * Sharing insights, results, and recommendations in a comprehensible manner through both written presentations/reports and interactions with teams/clients
   
   
   

The Ideal Candidate:

At Censeo, we are looking for unique candidates whose passion and enthusiasm will help shape Censeo’s client insights and workplace culture. Our staff have a wide range of backgrounds, areas of expertise, personality types, and favorite breakfast foods. Our client and cultural successes are rooted in our team’s innovation, creative problem solving, and collaboration. The unique perspective that you bring and the way you tackle problems are much more important to us than what’s printed on your diploma. We believe a successful Business Analyst will have:


 * BA/BS required with a strong academic background
 * Superior creative problem-solving, analytical, and quantitative skills
 * Ability to work effectively on projects with demanding deadlines in a team environment
 * Effective written and verbal communication skills with an ability to share and synthesize knowledge
 * Ability and desire to take initiative and ownership over project work and professional development and growth
 * Knowledge and appreciation of business concepts
 * Knowledge of spreadsheet and presentation software
 * Interest in working with public sector clients

Business Analyst Job Responsibilities

If you read our business analyst job posting and thought, “That sounds great, but what is this job actually like?”, then keep reading!

The core function of our role as business analysts at Grant Street Group is to be a liaison between our developers and our clients, and this requires us to wear many different hats.

So what do all of these “hats” really mean?


 * Problem Solving: Every day you work to solve complex problems. When you analyze a calculation, investigate the cause of a bug, or propose a new process you are venturing into unfamiliar territory to find a solution. Our clients and developers rely on your problem solving skills to ensure our software is built and supported effectively.
 * Client support: When a customer has a question, problem, or suggestion, they come to you! You are known as a subject matter expert and our clients rely on that expertise regularly. Whether the issue is major or minor, you know that Grant Street Group takes Software as a Service literally.
 * Prioritization: Our software is ever-changing. With that comes the need to prioritize what, when, and how changes are made. Since you’re working with the software and our clients daily, who better to prioritize than you? Business analysts are constantly asking themselves: Does this feature need to be completed before a certain time? What is the impact of this bug? How can other clients benefit from this change? We use a ticketing system to track pieces of work such as functionality requests and bug fixes. We then prioritize them for developers to work on.
 * Technical Specifications: It’s your job to convey to the developers what changes need to be made. What happens when you click this button? What does the page look like? How is this file transferred to an external system? In this way, you are directly affecting the product and our clients’ experience.
 * Testing: When a developer completes a change, you get to test it out (in a beta environment) to ensure that it’s working correctly. Does the new behavior match the specification? Does everything else surrounding the change still work correctly?
 * Implementations: We’re a growing company and adding new clients is an exciting part of that growth! Since you’re a subject matter expert, you coordinate with new clients to configure the software to best fit their needs. Think of yourself as a consultant. What business processes does the client need to accomplish? How can our software fit in with and help that process?
 * Training: Helping clients learn about how our software works is also part of your role. Whether it’s a new client coming up to speed on how tasks are completed, or an existing client that is incorporating a new feature into their process, you’re a resource for providing the information and tools they need.
   
   

Does this sound exciting and overwhelming at the same time? Most of us thought so too. If you haven’t had experience in this area before, know that many of us lacked business analyst experience before we came to Grant Street Group. What we did have was intellectual curiosity and a passion for problem solving. If you’ve already had business analyst experience, that’s great, and we’re excited about the possibility of you continuing on that path with us.

So now that you know what we do, why are you a great fit? You’ve probably spent a large majority of your life asking “Why” and then making sure that you figure out the answer. You love using all parts of your brain equally, and the thought of speaking with a client or learning about a database schema equally intrigues you. You’re the one that people rely on in team projects. You’re always itching to know more and you hold yourself and others to a high standard.

Before you begin the interview process, keep in mind that we have a tendency to pay special attention to those that put in extra effort in their applications. We are radical proponents of the belief that you are more than just a resume. If you’re excited about this opportunity, we can’t wait to get to know you!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (40 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
